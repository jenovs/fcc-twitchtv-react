**Objective**: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/.

**Rule #1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

**Rule #2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story**: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

**User Story**: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

**User Story**: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

**User Story**: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.

**Hint**: See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Front-End-Project-Use-Twitchtv-JSON-API.

**Hint**: The relevant documentation about this API call is here: https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/v3_resources/streams.md#get-streamschannel.

**Hint**: Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: ["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]
